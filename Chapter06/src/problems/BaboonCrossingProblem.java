/*
 * The Baboon Crossing Problem is a synchronization problem in operating systems that models a group of baboons 
 * crossing a canyon using a single rope. The problem, inspired by descriptions like those found on educational 
 * websites, involves the following constraints:
 * 
 * Baboons are on both sides of a canyon (east and west) and want to cross to the opposite side.
 * A single rope allows baboons to cross by swinging hand-over-hand (brachiation).
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * The rope has a limited capacity (e.g., 5 baboons at a time).
 * All baboons on the rope must move in the same direction to avoid deadlock 
 * (e.g., if eastbound and westbound baboons meet, they get stuck).
 * A baboon cannot join the rope if itâ€™s at capacity or if baboons are moving in the opposite direction.
 * Continuous streams of baboons in one direction must not starve baboons wanting to cross in the opposite direction.
 *
