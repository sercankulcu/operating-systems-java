/*
 * Here is an example of a Java program that uses a page and buffer to read data from a file:
 * 
 * In this example, the BufferedReader class is used to read data from a file in a page-by-page 
 * fashion. The read method reads a page of data into a buffer, and the number of characters read 
 * is returned. The page of data is then processed by the processPage method. This process is 
 * repeated until the end of the file is reached. 
 * 
 * Using a page and buffer to read data from a file can be more efficient than reading the entire 
 * file at once, especially for large files. The page size can be adjusted to find the optimal 
 * balance between performance and memory usage.
 *
